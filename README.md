This repository contains fundamental code examples in quantum computing using major frameworks such as Qiskit, PennyLane, and Tket (the last specializes in quantum compilation).
<br> Until they are reorganized later as teaching materials, they can be a bit messy. 😉
<br> Currently, the following concepts are covered:
<ul>
  <li>Quipper and OpenQASM: Quantum Programming Languages</li>
  <li>How to extract specifications of quantum circuits/li>
  <li>Tket: The Quantum Compilation SDK</li>
</ul>
